<h1>The Idiot</h1>
<p>The Idiot is a card game, and happens to be my most favorite card game.  It's common name in english is Sh*thead, but I thought that might not be the best repo name.

<h2>Rules</h2>
<i>There are many variations on rules for this game. This particular variant will use the rules I learned while at Chapel Hill</i>
<p><b>Up to five people are dealt a hand of six cards as well as an additional three face-down cards.</b> (By convention the face-down cards are dealt first).
The remaining cards form a deck near the middle of the table.
<br />
<b>Each player then selects three cards from their hand to lay face-up on top of their face-down cards.</b>
These cards may only be played while the player has no more cards in their hand.
<br />
<b>A player must always have at least three cards in their hand while there are cards left in the deck.</b>
<br />
<b>The goal the game is to get rid of all your cards, and the last person to do so is the Idiot.</b>
