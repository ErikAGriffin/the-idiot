<h1>The Idiot</h1>
<p>The Idiot is a card game, and happens to be my favorite card game.  It's common name in english is Sh*thead, but I thought that might not be the most appropriate repo name.</p>
<p>
I would very much like to come back and finish this someday, but at the moment I don't have the time.  As I remember the Game Logic is almost completely finished, except that the special card '<b>8</b>' does not have its rules implemented.
</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<i>There are many variations on rules for this game. This particular variant will use the rules I learned while at Chapel Hill.</i>
<p><b>Up to five people are dealt a hand of six cards as well as an additional three face-down cards.</b> (<i>By convention the face-down cards are dealt first</i>).
The remaining cards form a deck near the middle of the table.
<br />
<b>Each player then selects three cards from their hand to lay face-up on top of their face-down cards.</b>
These cards may only be played while the player has no more cards in their hand.
Furthermore you may only play the face-down cards after all your face-up cards have been played.
<br />
<b>A player must always have at least three cards in their hand while there are cards left in the deck.</b>
<br />
<b>The goal the game is to get rid of all your cards, and the last person to do so is the Idiot.</b>
<br />
</p>
<p>
After setup play begins at the first player who places a <b>4</b> on the table. If no players have a <b>4</b>, then a <b>5</b> is asked for, and so on.
<br />
Play continues in a clockwise fashion, and each player must play a card that is of equal or greater value than the card on the table. <b>4</b> is the lowest value and <b>Ace</b> is the highest. This is because <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are two of four <i>special cards</i>, which we will address later.
<br />
If a player cannot produce a card of equal or greater value, <b>they are forced to pick up the cards on the table</b>, and it is the next player's turn.
</p>
<p>
<b>A player is allowed to play any number of cards that are of the same value at once.</b> That is, if a <b>5</b> is on the table, a player may play two <b>5</b>'s, four <b>6</b>'s, three <b>Kings</b> or any combination of a legal card they like.
<br />
<b>Any player, <i>at any time</i>, is alllowed to play cards of the same value as the current card on the pile</b>. This means that a player can skip others by placing a <b>Jack</b> on top of an already played <b>Jack</b>.  Play then continues left of the new position.
<br />
<b>Playing four cards of the same value at once causes to pile to <i>burn</i>.</b> Burning the pile means removing those cards from the game, and the player that did so gets to go again. Note that it is only whomever played the last card that matters, so laying a <b>7</b> on top of the previous player's three <b>7</b>'s will cause you to burn the pile.
</p>
<p>
The other way to burn the pile is by playing a <b>10</b>, one of the game's <i>special cards</i>.
<br />
There are four special cards in the game, three of which are <i>trump cards</i> that can always be played. The cards and their abilities are as follows:
</p>
<h4>2</h4> <b>Reset</b>
<p>
Trump card. This card resets the value of the pile, making it the same as an empty table.
</p>
<h4>3</h4> 
<b>Pass</b> <i>or Clone</i>.
<p>
Trump card. This card passes the current value on the table to the next player.
</p>
<h4>10</h4> <b>Burn</b>
<p>
Trump card. This card will burn the entire pile, and cause it to be your turn again.
</p>
<h4>8</h4> <b>Higher or Lower</b>
<p>
Upon playing this card the player announces <b>"Higher"</b> or <b>"Lower"</b>. The next player must then follow the rule announced by playing a value that is either higher or lower than an <b>8</b>. Note that this card cannot be played on cards <b>9</b> or higher. An <b>8</b> can always be played on an <b>8</b>, at which point a new rule is announced.
</p>
<h4>Nuances to the game</h4>
<p>
Burning the deck with four cards only works if they are touching. So if someone plays a <b>Queen</b> and the next player plays a <b>2</b> before you can get your three <b>Queens</b> on the table, the deck will not burn even if it is your turn.
<br />
--------------
<br />
A <b>3</b> is a pass. Therefore if the play is <b>"lower"</b> to you, you may play a <b>3</b> and pass <b>"lower"</b> to the next player, but you may not change the rule. It is for this reason a <b>3</b> is considered stronger than an <b>Ace</b>.
<br />
--------------
<br />
If it is your turn and you can legally play a card, you must play it.
<br />
--------------
<br />
A player may only play out of turn with cards that are identical to the one currently on the pile. So if an <b>Ace</b> is played and followed by a <b>3</b>, no player may play <b>Ace</b> out of turn but anyone with a <b>3</b> could do so immediately.
<br />
--------------
<br />
The cards on the table (<i>those face-down and the face-up ones on top of them</i>) may only be played while you don't have cards in your hand.  Therefore if you had started to play them, but then was forced to pick up the pile, you may not use them again until your hand is empty.
